They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc. We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack!

These were the first and they were bigger and yes, even softer than these are now.  But, at that time, they were the ONLY soft, prepackaged cookie (can you believe that?) besides Archway.  They then came out with at least a dozen other varieties but for some reason, they stopped making them.  I can remember every kid imaginable going nuts over these things so I'm wondering why they stopped.<br /><br />Anyway, back to today, these cookies, even though they're smaller, are still quite excellent.  They are just so soft and taste better than Keebler's other soft and chewy cookies.  This package made it about 20 minutes in this house - that's what happens when you're raising a bunch of Titan boys!<br /><br />Great, great stuff, HIGHLY recommend!"

Actually, my cat preferred the regular Friskies over this one.  He's not really all that jazzed over these Fancy Feast varieties anyway, so if you're going to buy this one or the chicken, save your money and buy the regular Friskies versions.  They seem to taste better to the cat and it saves you money.  I've never had a cat that ever got too thrilled over this variety over the years so I guess I'll get the special ones instead."

Friskies doesn't look as fresh or as appetizing as 9 Lives, and my cat doesn't like it as well.  It just smells nasty and looks not quite as good as the 9 Lives.  I think they could definitely do better on this variety -maybe even add cheese to it!  My cat leaves this one in the dish but eats the 9 Lives version."

I do wish they'd make this one not ground but in the pieces variety too.  My previous cat really liked this one and usually licked the bowl clean.

He just licks himself for hours after eating this one and just loves the taste.  He will lick the bowl clean on this one and eats it usually pretty quickly.  But, he still doesn't want it more than 2-3 times a month because it's fish - not exactly his favorite food.  It's a great diversion from his regular fare and one that he truly appreciates."

It smells nasty but I think it's just the taste that really gets them.  My current cat just won't touch it - he might eat a couple of bites if he's REALLY hungry, but I always wind up throwing it out.  This one is ground so if your cat likes pieces, don't try this one."

I usually buy a case of this one at a time and judging from how often it sells out, other cats must love it too.  The cheese hunks are large and look quite tasty.  It's just a very nice variety and something I'm sure every cat loves.  My previous cat about ran me down whenever I got it out to give to him and my current cat is no different.  Give this one a try - you'll be glad you did!"
6383,B000084EK8,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,2,2,3,1090972800,Not the favorite in our house,"Once or twice a year for a little variety and that's about enough for my cat of this particular variety.  He likes it for a change from his chicken, turkey and beef, but not very often.  He will eat about 3/4 of the can and then he's had enough. He's not a huge fish fan anyway, but this stuff looks to be about the best out there in the fish varieties.  The chunks are bit sized so if your cat has a small mouth like mine does, it will be easier to chew.  Don't know why my cat doesn't like this type of fish, but he really could care less about it."

It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one."

But, he liked the taste of it a lot so I have been buying it off and on throughout the years.  My previous cat really liked it so I've purchased quite a few of these.  It's got that liver smell to it but they like it so who cares? If your cat likes ground, give this one a try for sure."

It's great stuff - the gravy is so very thick and the food looks like bits of steak slicked off for your friend.  My cat licks the bowl clean every time and wants more.  They should send me discounts for as much of this stuff I buy.  I buy it by the case if that gives you some idea!
6396,B000084EK6,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,0,0,5,1091059200,Great food!,"This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
6397,B000084EK7,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,0,0,4,1090972800,What's in this?,"This one is a great basic food. Whatever is in it, cats really go for and mine is no exception.  My current cat really doesn't like the ground variety which is what this is.  He will eat it occasionally, so I only buy it about twice a year.  My previous cat had to have it more often and really enjoyed it.  It's hard to judge what a cat will eat so if your cat likes ground, give this one a go because it really seems to be a big favorite."

Therefore, I purposely only tried the Columbian.<br /><br />I work in a place that has poorly serviced coffee ""dispensing machines."" They are fun in that you never know what will come out in a day-to-day basis. Some time just your coins back. A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.<br /><br />Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual.  Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave.  Shake contents to bottom of pack.  Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth.  Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds.  Add a tad of ice.

This can make them vomit so my trick is to snap them in two so then they have to chew them because of the ragged edges.  I""m used to the snapping since I have Persians (they have smaller mouths than a regular Tom does) and these aren't hard to snap at all.  They love the taste of these although I'm not all that sure they really help with the furballs.  Does anything really help though?! :)  I do recommend these because of the great taste, but try snapping them in two if your cat has trouble vomiting after gulping his/her food."

Just another can of cat food to try! My female loves this stuff, can't wait to get it in her dish, and gets quite angry whenever she gets anything else but this or the tuna variety. My male, forget it!  He loves the shredded turkey and cheese but won't go near this one.  Weirdest thing in the world to me - thought he'd go gaga over it like he does his turkey, but he just won't touch this stuff.  Anyway, this is a bit pricey here so check around for a better price.  At least in Ohio it's a bit high!  Highly recommend!"
11777,B0012KB4WU,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,c2,3,3,4,1249257600,Best of the florentines,"This one seems to be flavored more to a cat's liking than the rest of the Florentine varieties.  They're expensive, so buy one of each to see what floats with your cat but here, one will eat this and the other one won't.  It is gobbled up quite quickly too, I might add, by one of them so there you go!  Anyway, the greens addition is great for cats, they seem to like it in their other varieties, and they're high on the nutrition scale. So, if you're looking for higher protein and better nutrition all around, be sure to give these a go.  In our house, the pates have fared the best over the shreds and particularly, these florentines.  The egg soufles seem to be the favorites here - they ""hoover"" them down so fast they barely come up for air!  Recommend!"

It's just entirely more smooth, no bitterness at all, and just a very enjoyable cup of coffee.

It's quite amazing the difference this low acid coffee can make to your stomach and I could even drink the entire pot of the stuff! Normally, I take coffee completely black, no additives whatsoever.  But, with this french roast, it's quite strong.  REALLY strong and definitely, less is better in the pot. If you're a fan of Starbuck's Verona coffee and have no trouble drinking that stuff black, this is your best bet for a low acid coffee.  Combined with cream and sugar, then no problem.<br /><br />I tried this coffee just wondering if I could really tell the difference between regular and low acid coffee.  There IS a difference! The flavor is quite good but doesn't end smoothly like oh, say, Folger's might, but this is a gourmet coffee and will carry a stronger punch than a commercial coffee like Folger's will.  I plan on trying a different roast too since my tastes are more towards a full-bodied coffee instead of the kind that tastes like it was made in Texas during the Wild West days!  This ends a bit rough, kinda like the Starbuck's Verona, not as smoothly as I would prefer.  I made it with bottled water, not tap, to get the full flavor and aroma, so keep that in mind when deciding on which flavor to choose.  I am going to continue to play with this flavor to see if I can get it to suit my tastes better.  If you try it and it's too strong, then I suggest you dump the pot onto your roses!  Makes them quite gorgeous, actually!<br /><br />This is a great product, particularly if you're looking for the low acid variety.  I sincerely doubt you'll find a better low-acid coffee out there.  But, if you're like me and prefer a more smooth, well-rounded roast, then I suggest you try one of the other roasts.  Great product, highly recommend!"

It has to be the strangest smelling cat food I've ever used, which is why I wanted to write this review.  Just thought it was rather strange. I don't plan on buying it again because of that - the smell is Blech!  It isn't her favorite food, but it's tolerable, especially if mixed with a little meat.

Yes, he's quite the character but normally loves Fancy Feast, along with many others Friskies distributes.  These do contain a higher level of protein than most cat foods which makes them great for a rescue cat like my female.  It helped build up her muscle mass (as well as her vocal chords!) and put the necessary weight on her tiny frame.  Great, great product, she goes completely mad for it, highly recommend!"

I suppose that's what happens when you cook from scratch for a bunch of boys nightly!  So, when I mentioned that we were going to try this, the number of moans and groans almost outweighed the sound of the hamburger cooking in the skillet.  But, were we ever in for a surprise.  This stuff is awesome!  It actually includes a large packet of smooth Velveeta cheese to mix in with the entree and just that one element really makes it go over the top in taste.  Mind you, if you'd like to save the calories from the cheese packet, the entree tastes great without it.<br /><br />My only complaints are: 1), it's a bit salty.  This is particularly heightened after adding that packet of cheese.  It's not over the top like some soups can be, but it's definitely a negative.  If you're on a salt-controlled diet, this might be an issue. 2). The actual serving size of the package is small.  And I mean, VERY small.  If you have a family of 3, then each individual would get one serving.  Any larger than that, then you're in trouble unless you have VERY young children.  If you have a hungry husband and sons, you'll wind up buying 3 boxes to actually make enough to fill them up.  My suggestion: add a salad with meat, along with a vegetable and some healthy bread and that helps considerably.  In addition, add something like a can of diced tomatoes to this dish and use ground turkey or chicken to make it healthier.  Milk to drink always helps too.  There is enough sauce to add an additional 1/2 pound of meat to the dish, along with the tomatoes, and the cheese sauce can cook a bit longer in the pan to make it more ""runny"" to infuse with the additional ingredients.<br /><br />So, this is definitely a ""keeper"" in this house.  I about fell off my chair when I heard a ""Yum!""  But, Velveeta has been creating ""Yums"" for years and I am not surprised that this dish is in keeping with their history. Highly recommend!"

A few people have illicit electric coffee pots, others use a French press, and still others sneak out for the real thing.<br /><br />Now that I discovered the Columbian Via. I have to defend my cup from all those noses that circle my cup. I know there are directions on the pack; however, I now have my own ritual. Clean cup, fill 2/3rds filtered water. 90 seconds in the microwave. Shake contents to bottom of pack. Rip the whole top off the pack with teeth. Pour pack in coup and watch sizzle. Stir for a few seconds. Add a tad of ice. Hope I can make it back to my desk before the cup empties.<br /><br />I was never a fan of reconstituted coffee however I think it is the addition of the micro-ground coffee that adds the edge necessary.<br /><br />In any event you owe it to yourself to try it."

It's true.","Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />Sincerely, R.A.

I do not use any additives so the tea has to taste good without sugar, cream, or whatever.<br /><br />After slurping my way through several of these 50 bag boxes I had an opportunity to try that other stuff from Sir Thomas Lipton and had to spit it out I forgot what it used to taste like.  I cannot say it is the company or the tea mix but I find that I am now addicted to this tea. Even though I can still drink other types of tea that black and pekoe stuff just does not cut it.

It didn't last quite as long as 5 Hour Energy, but very close to it. And here's the catch. It's literally half the price of the other brands.

I'm still right smack in the middle of my last shot, and it's working just fine.

The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack.

A+!!!","This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS"">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"

Anyway, you HAVE to try the oatmeal cinnamon cookie recipe on the back.  It is totally awesome!  They make a zillion, literally.  You can bake a batch for your family and still have enough to give to a neighbor.  They are NOT those hard, nasty, crumby crunchy things either.  Not by a long shot.  They're just so soft and chewy, moist, ahhh.  You gotta LOVE Hershey!  This is the one weird item that we, the forgotten people in Ohio, can get at the grocery on a regular basis, depending on where you shop.<br /><br />However, if you're looking to make something like cinnamon bread, these are not your guys.

She grabbed some wet, went to this, went back grabbed more wet, back to this, it was quite comical!  She loves the taste of this dry food, however, it's terribly hard for her to eat it.  The kibble is quite large and I'm trying to figure out if the makers thought they were making this for dogs!  She mostly has to swallow it whole unless I put some in a plastic baggy and whack it with a hammer.  They're just too stiff to snap in half with your fingers.<br /><br />Other than that, I do recommend this, but if your cat has a small mouth like mine, you might want to try something else.

I got to the local grocery and picked up the VERY last one (and I even had a coupon!).  The waiting didn't disappoint - the flavor is rich, smooth, and although it comes close to resembling vanilla, the pumpkin flavors come through magnificiently.  It is not too heavy on the allspice and allows the nutmeg and cinnamon to shine. It is robust, never too weak, and has enough body to be strongly highlighted when coupled with cream and sugar.  If you use a frothing machine, no kidding, it beats Starbucks!  I like to buy enough of these fall and winter coffees before they're gone just because I like to enjoy them all winter here in cold, blustery, blowing snow down your chimney, Ohio.

He wouldn't even TRY this stuff and it sat in his bowl for over a month! No kidding, we left him alone for a day while we were swimming and he starved himself over eating this food. About had my leg taken off when I returned home too (and if you've ever seen the size of a Persian's feet, you know that that was a near amputation...). The kibble is a bit larger on this food so if you're buying it for a cat with a smaller mouth say, oh, like a Persian, then this might be an issue. But if not, then maybe you'll have better luck than I did! Thinking the size was putting him off, I actually broke some into smaller pieces.  But, it was the taste - he wouldn't even eat it out of my hand.  It's a great natural food (but the kibble looks dark green, ewww!) without animal by products, but if they won't touch it, well, guess there's nothing you can do about that. Try it - but try it at your local petsmart first because if you get a slap from your cat as you walk by, well, they'll take it back and give you something else!  Comment | Permalink"

Possibly because of the 5 pound sack of sugar in every drop but, lo and behold, Maxwell House bought them out and actually made this a great product!  I've had pumpkin lattes at both Starbuck's and Panera Bread and this product, no kidding, rivals them both!  It's honestly better than Starbucks and is almost equal to Panera's.  It's honestly that good and coming from me, you can believe that!  It has a very smooth, creamy top that seems to be from a latte machine (so, how do they do that?).  Just a nice, warm drink on a blustery fall day, not overly flavored with cloves either, just in case you're wondering about that spice.  Clove seems to cause problems with other products with pumpkin, leaving that weird, almost as if you've eaten licorice feeling in your mouth.  In addition, I'd like to know why it makes that popping sound when you put a teaspoon of the product into the water?)<br /><br />The one thing that Maxwell House hasn't solved is the problem they have with dissolving all of the product into the water.  That problem is still there and I suppose you could solve that with an electronic hot beverage mixer such as Mr. Coffee produces.  Also present is problem number 2 with International Coffees: you have to use at least 10 teaspoons to get the stuff to taste like anything.  They haven't changed that yet either.  I used 9 teaspoons in about 8 ounces, if that gives you some idea.  If you drink a mug of about 12-16 ounces, you'll only get about 5 cups out of this package.  Teacups, and I mean the kind that are used in England, you'll get about 20 cups from it.  But our large American mugs are going to require a great number of teaspoons to keep it from tasting like colored water.<br /><br />Other than that, I really like this product - so much so that I'm going out to buy more.  Something I've never done with International Coffee before.  Well done, Maxwell House and as Teddy Roosevelt said years ago, it's ""Good to the last drop."""

To say in the least, dad's friend was a bit offended, and said, ""Disgusting way to make tea!""  Back then, however, Lipton was the only brand to buy here in the U.S. worth having.  I've been served Lipton for 40+ years and have always enjoyed it, never having ""real"" tea until I traveled to England a few years ago.  Awesome stuff too, there really is no comparison I might add, and I now fully understand my dad's friend's complaint!<br /><br />Now to the question, I'm wondering if anyone else out there has noticed a significant difference in Lipton over the past 2 years.  It just does not seem to be as strong to me as it once was, and takes an unusually long time to brew compared to years past.  Its normal robust flavor has weakened, or so it seems, and it somewhat resembles a knock-off brand of tea instead of the Lipton we've come to expect.  When making iced tea, we now have to use 8 bags per gallon instead of the usual 6.  Honestly, I've started going to specialty tea shops in town to get Yorkshire tea, something I KNOW is served in England.

I can recommend it for children, if you will, but if you're expecting the Lipton we've always known, I'm afraid that you might have to start using 2 teabags per cup."

I had been tempted before to buy a bottle & try it, but I don't drink a ton of caffeine products and I almost never drink ""energy"" drinks.  So I was very skeptical and wary of this product.  But after my friend said he liked it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />My problem is I'm either a zombie in the morning, or I feel good in the morning but by about 3:30pm or 4:00pm I can barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to give this a try to see if it made any difference.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it does seem to work for me.  I've noticed that it works better when I'm tired in the afternoon than when I'm tired in the morning.  I don't feel extremely jittery and I suppose the claim of no crash is true because I never feel like I hit a wall.<br /><br />I usually notice it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes to kick in.  And I generally go from feeling like I'm going to nod off at my desk to at least being able to keep my eyes open & get some work done.  I don't feel like it gives me any super powers, hyper concentration, etc., and I don't feel like I have so much energy I'm bouncing off the walls.  Just a little boost.<br /><br />The flavor is okay; these are berry and it's kind of tart - like the flavoring is covering a bitter taste.  It's not awful, but it's not a flavor I would want to savor in a drink, etc.  I chug the thing and try to taste it as little as possible.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I'm also not using it every day.  Maybe 3 days a week.  So in that respect it's no worse than a daily Starbucks habit price-wise.  If I ever start to build a resistance to the combination of stuff that makes it work, I wouldn't try drinking MORE to counter act the effects, I would probably save my money and try something else.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm happy with how it's working for me for now.  I do feel more alert and I don't feel jittery or like I have nervous energy to burn.  When this batch is gone I'll probably get more, but I don't know that with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Pros<br />* It does give a boost of energy and I don't feel like I crash<br />* The flavor isn't as bad as I would have guessed<br /><br />Cons<br />* They're expensive, even buying them in bulk<br />* The flavor isn't as good as I would have hoped<br />* Doesn't give INSTANT energy.  Takes 10-15 minutes and is gradual<br />* Possible to build a resistance to the product? More time/use required to know for sure"

There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.  Maybe it has to do with how much I've eaten before drinking this?<br /><br />The best thing about this, though, is there's no drugged feeling.  And I sleep well the night after I take this.  All-in-all, it's been a good boost for me, though.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.

So sleep is a coveted prize.<br /><br />I originally was drinking Monster energy drinks. While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel. I tried coffee as an alternative, and that was a guarentee for a rebellious stomach, and the stuff usually took a good hour to really have effect no matter how strong I made it.<br /><br />I stumbled onto 5-hour energy when hiding in a 7-11 during a sudden downpour on my walk to the office, and figured, ""Eh, why not."" I'd seen a few commercials, but kinda just wrote it off - primarily because I utterly hated that their early commericals were almost entirely a smear against other alternatives. I chugged it, then headed back on my walk once it was clear.<br /><br />I was awake and alert by the time I got to the office, and I'd only downed half the bottle.

It is clearly an increase in energy, but that doesn't mean that you'll experience anything similar to the energy boost from a sugar high. It's a much more controlled boost in energy.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone who is in generally good health.

It's true.","Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"

It's healthy all right, but there are many other products out there that are just as healthy but have all the flavor as well.  If you don't like spices, then this is your soup.  However, since I make my own and we're more used to flavor, this one just doesn't cut the broth."

A+!!!","This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS"">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"

After having most of his teeth removed, he can no longer chew these hunks of meat, which are at least 1/2 inch long in some cases.  They're great on flavor, contain a lot of rich gravy, but if your cat cannot chew, there's no way they can manage with this one unless they swallow it whole. I have to resort to the shreds, which he LOVES, but he liked these for a change once in awhile.  I heat them up too before serving them since the older cats get, they can sometimes lose their sense of smell. Works like a charm if yours isn't eating.  Recommend based on past experience, but the are other varieties that appear to be more tasty for the cats.  Particularly their shreds."

Absolutely delicious.,"First, let me start of by saying that if you don't like other vinaigrette dressings, you're not going to like this one either. It's still made primarily with oil and vinegar. Some people can't stand the way it tastes on a salad, much preferring the creamy dressings. (Which have their place.) But if you like vinaigrettes in general, and raspberry vinaigrette in particular, then this stuff is freakin' spectacular. It has a nice sweet fruity flavor, but almost no sugar. It has that vinegar zip and zing, but not overwhelmingly so. A little bit coats a LOT of lettuce, and it's so delicious that I often find myself surprised by the fact that it has so few calories. This stuff is so good, I'm able to stick to my salad and soup diet, and lost 93 pounds when I first started, which was before I got sick. Since I got sick, I've lost a LOT of weight, but I STILL stick to this dietary plan because the dressing is so good.<br />  Another nice twist, though it has a bit more calories, is Ken's Raspberry Pecan dressing. I've been unable to find it here on Amazon, but my local store carries it. Their other vinaigrette's are just as delicious, though this raspberry walnut remains my favorite. (Another good one is: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00374WLNU"">Ken's Light Balsamic Vinaigrette - 6 Pack</a>) Again, if you like vinaigrette dressing in general, then this is one of the best ones I've ever tasted. Ken's makes a pretty good line of dressing, whether you're in the market for the vinaigrette's, or just looking for some pretty darn good Ranch. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MZ2GZW"">Kens Ranch Dressing (Case of 60)</a> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00436SF7C"">Kens Fat Free Ranch (box of 60)</a>) If you're looking for a vinaigrette that's a cut above the rest, then give this stuff a try.

These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own ""candy"" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.  But I suppose adding that would affect the texture and possibly the taste."

Yum, yum, yum.","I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused ""Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing.""  I'd never heard the words ""wafer"" and ""protein"" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own ""candy"" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.

419376,B0029ZAOW8,A2P4DZ9LG66F7M,jcazz,1,1,4,1333065600,"I'm surprised, but so far it works for me","A friend mentioned that 5-Hour worked well for him.  I had been tempted before to buy a bottle & try it, but I don't drink a ton of caffeine products and I almost never drink ""energy"" drinks.  So I was very skeptical and wary of this product.  But after my friend said he liked it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />My problem is I'm either a zombie in the morning, or I feel good in the morning but by about 3:30pm or 4:00pm I can barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to give this a try to see if it made any difference.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it does seem to work for me.  I've noticed that it works better when I'm tired in the afternoon than when I'm tired in the morning.  I don't feel extremely jittery and I suppose the claim of no crash is true because I never feel like I hit a wall.<br /><br />I usually notice it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes to kick in.  And I generally go from feeling like I'm going to nod off at my desk to at least being able to keep my eyes open & get some work done.  I don't feel like it gives me any super powers, hyper concentration, etc., and I don't feel like I have so much energy I'm bouncing off the walls.  Just a little boost.<br /><br />The flavor is okay; these are berry and it's kind of tart - like the flavoring is covering a bitter taste.  It's not awful, but it's not a flavor I would want to savor in a drink, etc.  I chug the thing and try to taste it as little as possible.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I'm also not using it every day.  Maybe 3 days a week.  So in that respect it's no worse than a daily Starbucks habit price-wise.  If I ever start to build a resistance to the combination of stuff that makes it work, I wouldn't try drinking MORE to counter act the effects, I would probably save my money and try something else.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm happy with how it's working for me for now.  I do feel more alert and I don't feel jittery or like I have nervous energy to burn.  When this batch is gone I'll probably get more, but I don't know that with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Pros<br />* It does give a boost of energy and I don't feel like I crash<br />* The flavor isn't as bad as I would have guessed<br /><br />Cons<br />* They're expensive, even buying them in bulk<br />* The flavor isn't as good as I would have hoped<br />* Doesn't give INSTANT energy.  Takes 10-15 minutes and is gradual<br />* Possible to build a resistance to the product? More time/use required to know for sure"

I've drank most of the rest of these and generally it gives me a bit of energy and does help me get through the day, but not like that first time.  There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.  Maybe it has to do with how much I've eaten before drinking this?<br /><br />The best thing about this, though, is there's no drugged feeling.  And I sleep well the night after I take this.  All-in-all, it's been a good boost for me, though.  I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.

While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel.

I compare this product to Diet Coke because regular Coca-Cola contains enough sugar to obscure the effects of its caffeine.<br /><br />With knowledge of its contents in mind, this product offers a subtle and extended increase in energy. It is clearly an increase in energy, but that doesn't mean that you'll experience anything similar to the energy boost from a sugar high. It's a much more controlled boost in energy.<br /><br />I recommend this product to anyone who is in generally good health.

It's true.","Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A.

So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk.

Yum, yum, yum.","I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused ""Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing.""  I'd never heard the words ""wafer"" and ""protein"" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own ""candy"" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.

I had been tempted before to buy a bottle & try it, but I don't drink a ton of caffeine products and I almost never drink ""energy"" drinks.  So I was very skeptical and wary of this product.  But after my friend said he liked it I figured I would give it a try.<br /><br />My problem is I'm either a zombie in the morning, or I feel good in the morning but by about 3:30pm or 4:00pm I can barely keep my eyes open.  I decided to give this a try to see if it made any difference.<br /><br />Surprisingly, it does seem to work for me.  I've noticed that it works better when I'm tired in the afternoon than when I'm tired in the morning.  I don't feel extremely jittery and I suppose the claim of no crash is true because I never feel like I hit a wall.<br /><br />I usually notice it takes 10, maybe 15 minutes to kick in.  And I generally go from feeling like I'm going to nod off at my desk to at least being able to keep my eyes open & get some work done.  I don't feel like it gives me any super powers, hyper concentration, etc., and I don't feel like I have so much energy I'm bouncing off the walls.  Just a little boost.<br /><br />The flavor is okay; these are berry and it's kind of tart - like the flavoring is covering a bitter taste.  It's not awful, but it's not a flavor I would want to savor in a drink, etc.  I chug the thing and try to taste it as little as possible.<br /><br />I think it's kind of pricy for what you get, but I'm also not using it every day.  Maybe 3 days a week.  So in that respect it's no worse than a daily Starbucks habit price-wise.  If I ever start to build a resistance to the combination of stuff that makes it work, I wouldn't try drinking MORE to counter act the effects, I would probably save my money and try something else.<br /><br />All-in-all I'm happy with how it's working for me for now.  I do feel more alert and I don't feel jittery or like I have nervous energy to burn.  When this batch is gone I'll probably get more, but I don't know that with 100% certainty.<br /><br />Pros<br />* It does give a boost of energy and I don't feel like I crash<br />* The flavor isn't as bad as I would have guessed<br /><br />Cons<br />* They're expensive, even buying them in bulk<br />* The flavor isn't as good as I would have hoped<br />* Doesn't give INSTANT energy.  Takes 10-15 minutes and is gradual<br />* Possible to build a resistance to the product? More time/use required to know for sure"

There is one other time I did get the same blast as the first time.

I'd definitely recommend it to someone like me who gets very tired in the afternoons and needs a boost of energy.<br /><br />I do like the berry flavor of the caffeinated version better than the citrus flavor this comes in.

While good, eventually my tolerance was so high I'd be drinking 2-3 of them just to keep going, which would start making my stomach rebel.

It's true.","Alright folks, so I'm just gonna lay all my cards on the table, because that's what you're supposed to do in an honest review right? I'm terminally ill, and I mean REALLY sick. I'm fighting hard, but it's a rough time. Part of that includes loss of muscle control, which includes the bladder, etc... Sheesh! LOL I was watching a review one morning on Fox News, after having been using this stuff for awhile, where the doctor they had on just TORE the energy drink business apart. He talked about how dangerous all of them were, and untested and how they basically don't work...<br />  Well I'm here to tell you otherwise. I went and got the EXACT bottle of 5 Hour Energy, Extra Strength, that I always buy, and which he was talking about. He was going on and on about how it was loaded with caffeine and was therefore bad for your heart. PLEASE! I've got the bottle IN MY HANDS right now folks. It states right on it, and this is the extra strength mind you, that it contains caffeine comprable to 12 oz. cup of coffee. That's not much! And yes, he was right that most of them work by being LOADED with sugar to go with the caffeine, and come with a REALLY bad crash afterwards. I experimented with some of the other products, and they taste delicious, but come with an AWFUL crash. This stuff doesn't taste so great because it has NO SUGAR, but it's just a tiny shot, and it works dammit.<br />  And then the doctor told the audience that it stimulates the nerves, and has been shown to cause nerve damage. I literally did a spit take. I was HORRIFIED. But low and behold, I talked to my own team of FIVE Neurologists that work on my case, and they disagreed. They said that a lot of the other drinks are unhealthy, diet-wise. This stuff causes what is called a Niacin Flush, and most of the energetic affects are from megadoses of vitamins. My Neurologists said that this stuff wasn't going to be hurting me, and at worst just might not work.<br />  But it DOES WORK! As I mentioned, I'm very sick. And that includes days when I am so weak I can't get out of bed or my chair. When I'm having nerve spasms, and can't control my muscles, I will sometimes have accidents when I fall asleep. I know the feeling well enough now to know, without doubt, when it will happen. Come on folks, I just admitted something really personal, and you can't get much more down in the dirt than that. LOL So when I feel that feeling, but am also really tired, I will drink one of these. It will keep me up and focused, and most importantly accident free, for between 3 and 5 hours while my nerve medications can kick in. And as those of us who have these problems can attest, that peace of mind, that time that is bought for us, ANYTHING to not make us incontinent if we can help it, is worth a LOT. Certainly the price of these little gems.<br />  The drink wakes me up, and it does NOT give me the jitters or make me edgy. I do not feel overwhelmed or hyper. It simply gives me the energy to get through my rough patch without falling asleep and waking up in a mess. LOL<br />  If there is one downside to this, it's the price. But I ask you this... How many of us are Starbuck's or expensive coffee fanatics? I was for YEARS. And we buy those mostly to help us to stay alert and awake through our day, and also because they are delicious. LOL These cost, per bottle, less than a Venti coffee. And seriously, they work. And that's what they are advertised to do, and that's JUST what they do. And that's all I NEED them to do. Not every product out there does what it says it will do. So that's a boost in my book right off the bat.<br />  I thank you for your time folks. Give these a try if you were needing a safe and least minimally harmful boost to your day during the more tired moments that we ALL have. I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"

I read the package and mused ""Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing.""  I'd never heard the words ""wafer"" and ""protein"" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.

So we turn to bottled water that is everything from the same local water just packaged to fancy mineral water that needs lime to mellow it out.

It goes down smooth and has no after taste. It is refreshing when cooled but can work well even at room temperature.

But these are perfect - just enough sweetness to ""hit the spot"" without triggering a sugar craving.  I guess if you are used the typical sugary granola bars [Nature Valley, Quaker Oats and chocolate], these might not be indulgent enough for you.

They're supposed to all be shredded but they do have a couple that are actually pates and well, up went the nose on those!

Right beside the Ritz and the Nabisco Premium Saltines.  I LOVE the buttery taste of these crackers and have been using them for about 35 years.  My parents before that always had them in the house. The one thing that can be a challenge is that I don't recommend that you put them in a bowl of canned soup.  The canned soup is usually overly salty anyway and these, well, they're a bit heavy on the salt as well.  If so, be sure to have steady access to water because you'll feel like you just consumed the Dead Sea!  Anyway, these crackers are best served with dips and made into appetizers.

The tea is so well sealed in its packets that the box smelled like a box. I suggest they put a little loose tea in the box to lure you in. Then I noticed a perforated section on the box to use your thumb to make an opening to dispense the packets.  Each serving comes in an individual foil packet with a little tear to show where to open the packet.  Inside the tea looks more like granules. They are sealed in the standard tea bag that has space in the middle when it unfolds. There is the tag tied to a string for dunking and extracting the bag after steeping. The ingredients description is black tea.<br /><br />The tea itself looks and tastes like the standard Lipton tea. If you close your eyes you cannot tell the difference.

However, these still have the same problem all chocolate and caramel bars have - you just can't carry them in your purse to snack on as you go.

Yum, yum, yum.","I stumbled upon these quite by accident: a co-worker left them in the kitchen (people often bring in leftovers or things to share).  I read the package and mused ""Creme filled wafer bar?  Intriguing.""  I'd never heard the words ""wafer"" and ""protein"" used in the same sentence.  But I remembered how much I used to love going to my grandma's house as a kid because she used to keep vanilla, chocolate and strawberry wafer cookies in the cookie jar.<br /><br />These tasty, light crunchy wafers do remind me of those wafer cookies from my childhood.  The peanut butter ones are sweetened with fructose and stevia.  Stevia is a natural swetener with a sightly unusual taste that might be jarring if you're not used it.  It's sweet, but doesn't taste quite like sugar, which is what I like about it.  These bars are just sweet enough to be enjoyable, but not sweet enough that I would want to devour a whole box of them like I would a candy bar.<br /><br />They are light and crispy, and perfect as a snack or a treat.  They're only 10 grams of carbs and 5 grams of sugar [just over a teaspoon] - perfect if you're watching your carbs and want a sweet[ish] snack.  I brought the chocolate one with me to the movies the other night, and while other people had their candy, I had my own ""candy"" to enjoy, without the suagr high and with the benefit of 13 g of portein.  I can't see a big, buff muscley guy getting a lot out of them [men need more calories & protein], but for me, they are the perfect addition to my health and fitness plan.<br /><br />The only thing I'd change [for nutritional purposes] would be to add more fiber.

Ritz has a very obvious garlic flavor, making them quite wonderful as a compliment to an Italian dinner.  These, however, have no garlic taste at all.  Just not what I expected after having Ritz's version.  They're good, just not flavored strongly enough for our tastes.  Recommend, but if you're looking for garlic, try Ritz."

A+!!!","This review is in reference to the 18 count pack of Tabasco flavored Monster Slim Jim's, although any size of the Tabasco Slim Jims are GREAT. (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQE3HS"">Slim Jim Giant Smoked Snacks, Tabasco, 0.97-Ounce Sticks (Pack of 24)</a>)<br /><br />  I love Tabasco sauce, and love the amazing synergy products they have made with other companies. So when I saw Tabasco Slim Jims, being a fan of Slim Jims anyway, I had to try them. The smaller sized ones, which I have been unable to find here on Amazon, taste great, but they are somewhat tougher than the larger versions, though not in a bad way. The medium sized and large ones, which this review is about, are much softer. Regardless, they are ALL delicious. They have the same spicy flavor that we Tabasco lovers have come to crave, but at the same time, since it was mixed in with other ingredients, it isn't so hot that you are forced to stop eating no matter how good it tastes. My friends and I all agree that it does have a high heat factor to it, and people who don't like spicy stuff might find it too much. But if you like spicy foods, these are an AMAZING snack. If you haven't tried them, then I highly recommend you get one from your grocery or convenient store. If you like them, buy them here since they are cheaper in bulk. Fans of Tabasco will not be disappointed. That's my $.02 on the matter folks.<br /><br />  Thanks you so much for your time folks.<br />  Sincerely, R.A. McDowell"

They have to have their ""man"" food so this one hasn't been too much of a hit.  My female loves pates, however, but she will only eat this one once in awhile, maybe once monthly.  They smell fresh and not too disgusting, so the product is okay - it just depends on your cat's tastes. Recommend, but try to get it somewhere else because I only pay about $.36/can.  This is pretty high."

I love this stuff - we grab it for a lot less here in our Ohio grocery stores, but it's well worth paying for it instead of making your own.  Sometimes, that brew cycle is just TOO long on your Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Pot and this comes in to the rescue.  It's VERY refreshing, gets rid of a caffeine headache very quickly, and just quenches your thirst.  Great, great stuff, been buying it for years.  Highly recommend!"

Keebler used to make the mint cookies for the scouts and one bite of these guys and you'll be astonished at the similarity! The cookie is chocolate, as is the fudge icing, and they're SO wonderful frozen in the summer! Smash them up as topping for your strawberries - yum!  Makes a great cookies and cream ice cream too or mint chocolate chip. They're in patty form, just like the York Peppermint Patty candy, but not quite as thick. LOVE these things, been buying them for years. Highly, highly recommend!"
